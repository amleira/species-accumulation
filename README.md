# **Species Accumulation Model in R**  
*A non-parametric approach for modeling species accumulation curves and efficiency calculations*  

## **Overview**
This repository contains an **R script** that implements **species accumulation models** using **constant species curves**. The script calculates **efficiency** based on the number of individuals counted and models species accumulation using a **logarithmic function**. The goal is to determine a **representative sample size** for biodiversity studies.

## **Features**
✔ Computes **efficiency**: The probability that a new species is not encountered as more individuals are counted.  
✔ Implements **constant species curves** using the formula:  
   \[
   f(x) = a \ln(x - n) - b
   \]
✔ Provides a **visual representation** of species accumulation with ggplot2.  
✔ Works with **varying sample sizes**, allowing customization for different ecological studies.  
✔ **Non-parametric modeling** allows for a flexible approach to estimating species richness.  

## **Usage**
### **1. Install Dependencies**
Before running the script, ensure you have **R** and the **ggplot2 package** installed:
```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
